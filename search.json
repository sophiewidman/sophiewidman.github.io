Nebraska Volleyball Day was a massive factor to Nebraska Volleyballs attendance numbers in the 2023 season. Attendance can be an indicator of how successful athletic programs are. Although we would need more data to distinguish who has the best fan base, Nebraska’s ability to sell out a football stadium for the volleyball team shows how passionate the fan base is about their teams and speaks for itself.\nIn the 2024 seasons it will be interesting to see how the attendance numbers change as Nebraska Volleyball Day will no longer be in the mix."
