One way that millions of fans show their fandom for their favorite teams is by attending games and events.

Volleyball day and a fan base that will always show up for their teams could lead to increased attendance.\nThe Huskers runner-up volleyball team had an undefeated record at home, and Nebraska fans were a big part of that.\n\n\nCode\npowerfivevolleyball &lt;- powerfive |&gt;\n  filter(sport ==\"Volleyball\") |&gt;\n  filter(year == 2023)\n\nnuvb &lt;- powerfivevolleyball |&gt;\n  filter(Institution == \"Nebraska\")\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=powerfivevolleyball,\n                    aes(x=reorder(Institution, `Accum Attendance`), weight=`Accum Attendance`),fill = \"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_bar(data=nuvb,\n                    aes(x=reorder(Institution, `Accum Attendance`), weight=`Accum Attendance`), fill = \"#E41C38\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Total Attendance\", \n    title=\"A World Record Helps with Attendance Numbers\", \n    subtitle=\"The Husker's filled Memomorial Stadium with 92,003 fans, breaking a world-record for a women's sporting event.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Sophie Widman\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreaking it down to just volleyball, Nebraska wins by a landslide. Nebraska Volleyball Day was a massive factor in Nebraska Volleyball’s attendance numbers in the 2023 season.\nAttendance can be an indicator of how successful athletic programs are. It would be difficult to determine who has the best fan base without looking at other factors, such as how big a school’s venue is or how successful the team is. But the Huskers’ ability to sell out Memorial Stadium for a 5-7 football team and to set a world record for a women’s athletic event speaks for itself.."
